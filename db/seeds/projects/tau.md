Tau [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Proghat/tau.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Proghat/tau) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tau.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/tau)
===

Tau provides you write code of webpages using modern technologies such as
haml, sass, coffee-script. You dont't need to compile your code to HTML and
CSS by hand everytime you something change.

Requirements
------------

You need ruby version **1.9.3** installed. See [rvm](https://rvm.io/).


Installation
------------

    gem install tau

Usage
-----

It's pretty simple.

### Getting started

1. Start new coding project and switch to that. In the command prompt run:

    `tau new example.com; cd example.com` *(where example.com is the project name)*

2. Create html or haml file on code directory:

    `echo '%h1 Hello <strong>tau</strong>!' > code/hello.haml`

3. Start server and go to [http://localhost:15000/hello.html](http://localhost:15000/hello.html):

    `tau server`

Attend even if you write hello.**haml** file you can see it by hello.**html**
in browser.

### Creating new project

Run `tau new projectname` and tau will make directory tree for you:

    projectname
    |--code - for your .html and .haml files
    |  |--js - for .js and .coffee files
    |  |--css - for .css, .sass and .scss
    |  `--img - for any type of images
    |
    `--tau.yaml - config file

### Coding

Run `tau server` in your project directory. Then put any html or haml files
into **code** directory, js or coffee files into **code/js**, css, sass or
scss into **code/css**. Now you can view files in browser by
http://localhost:15000/page.html or http://localhost:15000/css/style.css or
http://localhost:15000/js/script.js.

Attend that tau changes files extensions in browser from haml to html, from
coffee to js, from sass and scss to css. For example if you have
**code/js/myscript.coffee** file you can see it in browser by
http://localhost:15000/js/myscript.js.

In html or haml file you can include scripts written in coffee and styles
written in sass or scss. For example if you have **code/js/script.coffee**
script and **code/js/style.sass** spreadsheet you can include it to html by
lines:
```html
    <script src='js/script.js'></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
Anytime you change any file you can see updated version in browser. You don't
need to compile anything by hand.

### Building project

If you want to compile all files for releasing it in internet you don't need do
it by hand. `tau build` command compiles all sass, haml and other files and put
them into **build/** directory. Any files from **img** directory and not a haml, sass
or coffee-script files will copied without any changes. For example:
```
code/index.haml  ->  build/index.html
code/js/script.coffee  ->  build/js/script.js
code/img/logo.png  ->  build/img/logo.png
code/humans.txt  ->  build/humans.txt
etc...
```
